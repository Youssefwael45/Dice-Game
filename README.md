# Dice Game

A simple and fun dice rolling game where players aim to be the first to reach a target score.

## ðŸŽ¯ Game Description

This is a classic dice game with a twist! Players take turns rolling a single six-sided die. The goal is to accumulate points by rolling the die multiple times in a single turn. However, beware! If you roll a '1', your turn ends immediately, and you score zero points for that round. You can choose to "hold" your current turn score at any time to add it to your total score. The first player to reach or exceed 50 points wins the game!

**Key Features:**

*   **Multiplayer:** Supports 2 to 4 players.
*   **Interactive Gameplay:** Simple command-line interface for input.
*   **Turn-Based:** Players take turns rolling the dice.
*   **Risk vs. Reward:** Decide when to stop rolling to secure your points or risk rolling again for more.
*   **Clear Instructions:** Built-in instructions to guide new players.

## ðŸš€ How to Play

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd dice-game
    ```
    *(Replace `<your-repository-url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.)*

2.  **Run the Game:**
    The game is written in Python. You'll need Python installed on your system to run it. If you don't have Python, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

    Once you have Python installed, navigate to the game's directory in your terminal and run the script:
    ```bash
    python dice_game.py
    ```

3.  **Follow the Prompts:**
    *   The game will first ask you for the number of players (between 2 and 4).
    *   Then, it will ask for each player's name.
    *   The game will then display instructions.
    *   During your turn, you'll be prompted to roll the dice. Type `y` to roll, or any other key to stop and keep your current turn's score.
    *   The game continues until a player reaches the target score of 50 points.
    *   After the game ends, you'll be asked if you want to play again.

## ðŸ’» Prerequisites

*   **Python 3:** Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can check your installation by typing `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal.
